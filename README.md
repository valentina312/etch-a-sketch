# etch-a-sketch

Style a grid 16x16 with a hover effect that simulate etch-a-sketch
Insert a button at the top of the page that prompts the user for a size, and change the grid accordingly (in the same space as before 960px). Set the input limit to 100

Ver 1.0
In this version I learned to watch very carefully for typos, and that it's best to copy paste the class and id in selectors.
I also learned more about event listeners and flexbox.
The style is very simple, I'll come back in the future to make it more visually appealing
